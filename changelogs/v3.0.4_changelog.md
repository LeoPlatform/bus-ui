# Botmon v3.0.4 Changelog

## New Features

We have added a host of new features to Botmon. Which are detailed below.

As always if there are questions/issues using Botmon or if you have improvements you would like made reach out to [#h_rstreams](https://chubrox.slack.com/archives/C033LCSFHF0)

### Timezone Select

Added a new timezone select feature. This feature allows the user to change which timezone all timestamps are displaying as on the website. 

To use this feature click the meatball menu on the top right-hand corner of the page.

Then select one of the supported timezones from the dropdown. The page will automatically re-render to show. Additionally this selection will be saved.

### Bot Repository Links

A common issue when doing investigations for bots you may not be familiar with is understanding where the source code for that bot lives. We have added the ability to clickable link for the URL to a given bot.

Unfortunately there is no way for us to automatically add these links to every bot, but there are two easy options to add your own. 

Under the covers we are using the tagging system to store these URLs. Simply put all you need to do is tag your bot with a `repo` tag.

You can do this manually in the UI by selecting the bot in question and going to `Settings` tab and entering `repo:{URL}`, where `{URL}` should be the full URL, and clicking `Save`

The second option is to add the `repo` tag on your bot's serverless definition. This is the recommended option since there is less chance that future updates to the bot's code will remove the tag.

### Easy Copy of Bot Checkpoint
We have added the ability to copy the current checkpoint of the bot into your system's clipboard. To see this feature, navigate to a given bot and select the dropdown arrow next to the displayed checkpoint. Then click the `Copy Checkpoint` option.

## Performance Improvements

We have added a plethora of performance improvements. Such as

- Archived bots will not longer be loaded. They still exist they just won't be editable or displayed in botmon. 
- Scanning and Querying Dynamo tables in Parallel
- context caching for better query results from the `stats_v2` api


One important change that will affect users going forward is our decision to limited the number of parents/children that can be displayed to 10. If we do find a bot/queue/system that has more than 10 relationships in either direction we will display a placeholder icon with the message of `Too many {children/parents} refine by searching`

![Too Many Children](https://github.com/LeoPlatform/bus-ui/blob/changelog-screenshots/changelogs/screenshots/too_many_children.png?raw=true)

![Too Many Parents](https://github.com/LeoPlatform/bus-ui/blob/changelog-screenshots/changelogs/screenshots/too_many_parents.png?raw=true)

> [!NOTE]
> The relationships can still be viewed by viewing the bot/queue details. Which you can view by clicking the gear icon when hovering over a bot/queue
>
